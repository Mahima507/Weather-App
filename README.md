# Weather-App

A weather app created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a web-based application that provides users with current and forecast weather information for a particular location. The app's interface is designed using HTML and CSS to provide a visually appealing and intuitive user experience.

The weather data is obtained from an API that provides real-time weather information for a specific location. The app's JavaScript code is responsible for handling the API request, parsing the data, and displaying it on the app's interface.

The weather app typically includes the following features:

A search bar where users can input a location to get the weather information
Current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation
A graphical representation of the current weather conditions, such as an icon that shows if it's sunny, cloudy, rainy, or snowy
A forecast for the upcoming days, including the high and low temperatures and weather conditions
The ability to switch between different units of measurement such as Celsius and Fahrenheit
Overall, the weather app created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides users with an easy-to-use and accessible way to stay up-to-date with weather conditions for any location.
